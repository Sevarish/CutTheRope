Level solution: Cut the highest rope when the sliding(right) rope is at it's highest. This should get you the first Star.
Then, wait for the sliding rope to reach it's highest point again and cut the sliding rope. This should get you the second Star.
Lastly, let it swing back and forth once, and use the momentum to get into the bubble. The bubble will get you the third Star.
At last, pop the bubble and it should complete the level.
